# import-in-java
### In Java, the import statement is used to bring in classes, interfaces, or entire packages from external libraries or other packages into your current source file. This enables you to use those classes and interfaces without having to specify their full package names each time.
# Key Points:
### Purpose: The primary purpose of the import statement is to simplify the code by allowing you to use classes and interfaces directly, without needing to specify their complete package names.
### Placement: import statements are placed at the beginning of a Java source file, after the package declaration (if there is one) and before any class or interface definitions.
# Syntax:
### import package.name.ClassName;
### import package.name.*;
